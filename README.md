# Portfolio

![Portfolio Home Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52224377/109893368-27fcb480-7c51-11eb-84b9-97f7cdbb9eb4.PNG)

Portfolio website written in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The site was made to be mobile-friendly using CSS media queries.

I used the [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) library to give the website a nice full-screen scrolling experience.
